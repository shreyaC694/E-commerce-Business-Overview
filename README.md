# E-commerce-Business-Overview
## Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing e-commerce sales performance, product trends, and regional profitability using Power Query and DAX


What is this?
I built an interactive dashboard in Power BI that helps an online store understand its sales and profits. It turns messy Excel data into clear charts so a business can see what’s working and what isn’t.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/shreyaC694/E-commerce-Business-Overview/blob/main/Product.xlsx"> Product Dataset</a>
-<a href="https://github.com/shreyaC694/E-commerce-Business-Overview/blob/main/Customer.xlsx"> Customer Dataset</a>
- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/shreyaC694/E-commerce-Business-Overview/blob/main/E-commerce%20sales%20dashboard.pdf">View Static demo of Dashboard</a>

What does it show?

•	Best & Worst Sellers: The top 5 and bottom 5 products by sales

•	Money Matters: Total sales, total profit, and profit margins

•	Locations: A breakdown of sales in North America vs. South America

•	Monthly Trends: A month-by-month look at how the business is growing

•	Rating System: Automatically labels sales as "Good," "Average," or "Bad" based on the amount
Tools I used

•	Power BI: To create the charts and dashboard

•	Power Query: To clean up the data and join different tables together

•	DAX: To write custom formulas for things like "Profit Margin"
How to use it
1.	Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
