Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing e-commerce sales performance, product trends, and regional profitability using Power Query and DAX


What is this?
I built an interactive dashboard in Power BI that helps an online store understand its sales and profits. It turns messy Excel data into clear charts so a business can see what’s working and what isn’t.
What does it show?
•	Best & Worst Sellers: The top 5 and bottom 5 products by sales
•	Money Matters: Total sales, total profit, and profit margins.
•	Locations: A breakdown of sales in North America vs. South America.
•	Monthly Trends: A month-by-month look at how the business is growing.
•	Rating System: Automatically labels sales as "Good," "Average," or "Bad" based on the amount.
Tools I used
•	Power BI: To create the charts and dashboard.
•	Power Query: To clean up the data and join different tables together.
•	DAX: To write custom formulas for things like "Profit Margin".
How to use it
1.	Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
2.	Use the Filters at the top to change the view by Year or Region.
3.	Hover over any chart to see more specific details.
